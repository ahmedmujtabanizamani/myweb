Professor Rand thinks that in a mechanically determined universe, &ldquo;our conscious life becomes a meaningless replica of an inexorable physical concatenation&rdquo;&ndash;the soul the result of a fortuitous concourse of atoms. Hence all the science and art and literature and religion of the world are merely the result of a molecular accident.
Dr. Rand himself, in wrestling with the problem of organization in a late number of &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; seems to hesitate whether or not to regard man as a molecular accident, an appearance presented to us by the results of the curious accidents of molecules&ndash;which is essentially Professor Loeb&rsquo;s view; or whether to look upon the living body as the result of a &ldquo;specific something&rdquo; that organizes, that is, of &ldquo;dominating organic agencies,&rdquo; be they psychic or super-mundane, which dominate and determine the organization of the different parts of the body into a whole.

At the age of two thousand and eighty-eight years the fourth fire attacked it. This fire burned an eighteen-foot scar upon the trunk of the old tree. In 1900, after the lapse of almost a century, only a small part of this wound was overgrown. This year, 1900, came the reaper, the axeman, who laid low this aged and monumental tree!
<a href=/myweb/articles/article-416/>More...</a><h2><a href=/myweb/articles/article-417/>Article 417</a></h2>It is reported that a French scientist has discovered the secret of the glow-worm&rsquo;s light. Of course it is a chemical reaction,&ndash;what else could it be?&ndash;but it is a chemical reaction in a vital process. Our mental and spiritual life&ndash;our emotions of art, poetry, religion&ndash;are inseparable from physical processes in the brain and the nervous system; but is that their final explanation? The sunlight has little effect on a withered leaf, but see what effect it has upon the green leaf upon the tree!
<a href=/myweb/articles/article-417/>More...</a><h2><a href=/myweb/articles/article-418/>Article 418</a></h2>When we speak of force of mind, force of character, we of course speak in parables, since the force here alluded to is an experience of our own minds entirely and would not suffice to move the finest dust-particle in the air.
There could be no vegetable or animal life without the sunbeam, yet when we have explained or accounted for the growth of a tree in terms of the chemistry and physics of the sunbeam, do we not have to figure to ourselves something in the tree that avails itself of this chemistry, that uses it and profits by it?
<a href=/myweb/articles/article-418/>More...</a><h2><a href=/myweb/articles/article-419/>Article 419</a></h2>The forests of America, however slighted by man, must have been a great delight to God; for they were the best he ever planted. The whole continent was a garden, and from the beginning it seemed to be favored above all the other wild parks and gardens of the globe. To prepare the ground, it was rolled and sifted in seas with infinite loving deliberation and fore-thought, lifted into the light, submerged and warmed over and over again, pressed and crumpled into folds and ridges, mountains, and hills, subsoiled with heaving volcanic fires, ploughed and ground and sculptured into scenery and soil with glaciers and rivers,â€”every feature growing and changing from beauty to beauty, higher and higher.
